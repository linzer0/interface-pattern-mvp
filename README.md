# Unity MVP Pattern Example

This repository contains a Unity project that demonstrates the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern in the context of a simple example. MVP is a design pattern that helps separate concerns in your code, making it more organized and easier to maintain.


## Introduction

The Model-View-Presenter pattern is a variation of the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, tailored for Unity and other game development platforms. It separates the responsibilities of your code into three main components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
- **View**: Handles the user interface and presentation.
- **Presenter**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, communicates with the Model, and updates the View.

This project will help you understand how to implement the MVP pattern in a Unity application.

## How MVP Works

- **Model**: The `ProfileModel` class contains the profile's data and logic, such as name and level.

- **View**: The `ProfileView` class manages the visual representation of the profile like name and level.

- **Presenter**: The `ProfilePresenter` class acts as an intermediary. It communicates with the Model to respond to data changes and update them in the View.

By separating these concerns, the code becomes more maintainable and testable, and it's easier to collaborate with other developers on the project.
